# Chapter 3:

## Recursion:

Recursion is where a function calls itself and it has two cases:

- Base case
- Recursive case

**Quote:** Loops may achieve performance gain for your program. Recursion may achieve a performance gain for your programmer. Choose which is more important in your situation.

## Stack:

Stack is a data structure built on first in last out strategy. and your computer memory uses a stack internally called the call stack.

## Recap:

- Recursion is when a function calls itself.
- Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and recursive case.
- A stack has two operations: push and pop.
- All function calls go into the call stack.
- The call stack can get vey large, which takes up a lot of memory and may exit with a stack overflow error.
